    <P>These pages are owned and maintained by the Friends of the Groton Trails Network. Our goal is to provide a user-friendly trail system that 
	encourages residents to enjoy the open spaces and conservation land in Groton. We encourage people to see a different perspective of Groton 
	by exploring our trails and parts of town never seen from the roadways. We promote the trails 
	by setting up and staffing booths during <a href="http://www.grotonfest.com/">Grotonfest</a>, 
	organizing hikes, and supporting the annual <a href="http://www.grotontftr.freeservers.com/">Groton Town Forest Trail Races</a>. </P>

    <p>We promote and support the work of the <a href="http://www.townofgroton.org/Town/BoardsCommittees/TrailsCommittee.aspx">Groton Trails Committee</a>, 
	which is responsible for developing new trails and maintaining the existing trails network in Groton. 
	Together we evaluate trail routes, consider safety issues, address parking and access, mark new trails, and 
	revise the trail map to reflect additions and changes. We also organize hikes and work parties and are 
	always looking for participants. </p>
