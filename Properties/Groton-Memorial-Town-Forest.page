  The Groton Memorial Town Forest was established in 1922 as a memorial to the 
  men who gave their lives in World War I. It is owned by the town of Groton and 
  is managed by the Town Forest Committee. The Town Forest is one of the more popular places 
  in Groton to enjoy the outdoors. It offers plenty of space to explore and beautiful views 
  of the Nashua River. The site has a large variety of trails that are excellent for leisurely strolls, mounting 
  biking, horse back riding, dog walking, and nature watching. It is also the 
  site of the annual Groton Town Forest Race. 
  <p>The parking lot at the end of town forest road has ample space as well as a 
  turning circle for horse trailers.
