description: |
  The Farmers And Mechanics Club property is part of the trail network that follows the east side of the Nashua river starting in Ayer ending at Fitch's Bridge. 
  Parking is available at <a href="http://hgaa.org/">Hazel Grove Park</a>, and at the Groton Place (aka Dog Park). The trail offers wonderful views of the Nashua river.
  The trail that directly follows the Nashua river is unmarked, and ends in a dead end on private property, the trail to Fitch's Bridge is marked, and 
  cuts east away from the river at the south end of the property.
