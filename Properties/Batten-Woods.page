  Batten Woods and <a href="Woodland-Pond-Conservation-Area.html">Woodland Pond Conservation Area</a>
  form a small network of trails that include views of Carmichael Swamp. There is a longer trail
  that goes north to Hidden Valley Road eventually connecting to Duck Pond. The trails to the east of the 
  Batten Woods property line are private and should be avoided. There is some on street parking 
  at the end of Orion Way.
