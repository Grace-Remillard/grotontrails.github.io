<h3>Come Meet Us</h3>
  <p>Each month the <a href="http://www.townofgroton.org/Town/BoardsCommittees/TrailsCommittee.aspx">Groton Trails Committee</a> meets 
     to discuss the status of ongoing projects, plan new projects, schedule work parties, update our trails projects list of current and 
	 future tasks, and report on problems and discuss solutions. The current meeting schedule calls for the meeting <strong> on the 3rd Tuesday of every 
	 month </strong> <em> at 7:00pm at Groton's Legion Hall</em>, 75 Hollis Street. <Br/>It is always advisable to check 
	 the Groton Town web site for meeting updates or use the email address below for confirmation. The meeting is open 
	 to the public and visitors are always encouraged to attend and participate. If you have a specific topic to discuss 
	 please email the Trails Committee <a href="mailto:	trails@townofgroton.org">trails@townofgroton.org</a> to get a 
	 slot assigned on the agenda. </p>

    <p>Join our low volume email list to learn about and discuss the trails of Groton including activities, work parties, and 
	trails advocacy. We will use this list to notify you of our guided hikes, bike rides, ski or snowshoe events, 
	and similar excursions. When we organize work parties we will also post a call for volunteers using this list.</p>

    <p>As a group member you can post questions and answers on your favorite trail, 
	trail conditions (e.g. "there is a tree down on the XYZ trail"), if you have suggestions for a 
	trail reroute around a wet spot, or similar.</p>

    <p>To join please send an email with your full name to <a href="mailto:trails@townofgroton.org">trails@townofgroton.org</a>, and we will 
	send you an invitation. This way we can keep spammers away.</p>
	
	<p>The archive of the email list is available on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/grotontrails">Friends of Groton Trails Network Google Group</a>.
